## Advanced Algorithms Tasks



1. Write a program to implement the Josephus problem, with n, m, and k as external inputs, print the output.
[Note] Sequential storage or linked storage can be used.

2. Write a program with multiple functions to implement the addition of a univariate polynomial.
It is required to 
    1. Input two univariate polynomials first.
    2. Then establish corresponding linked lists.
    3. Then calculate the addition.
    4. Finally, output the new polynomial.

3. Write a program that implements the input, transpose, and output of a sparse array represented by triplet. You can directly enter the triplet. The output result requires:
    1. Print the original input triplet and the corresponding matrix form;
    2. Print the transposed triplet and the corresponding matrix form.
    3. When printing in matrix form, the triplet must not be converted to a two-dimensional array.

4. Write a program to achieve n-dimensional (n is an odd number) magic square. n is an external input parameter, and the output results are arranged in a square matrix.

5. Write a program that implements the addition of two sparse matrixes represented by triple. 
Program requirements:
    1. Input sparse matrixes in the form of triplet;
    2. Write a function that implements the addition of two triples represented matrixes.
    3. Print the result of the addition in the form of triplet.

6. Write a recursive program to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. The number of disks is controlled by keyboard input, and print the order in which the disks are moved.

7. Write a program that implements the conversion of the infix expression to the postfix expression. Requirements:
    1. the keyboard enters an expression and ends with the character #;
    2. The output is in the form of a postfix expression.

8. Write a program, create a binary sort tree and traverse the binary sort tree with a inorder traversal algorithm. 
Requirements:
The binary sort tree is created in ascending order. The data is input through the keyboard, and the input ends with -1.

9. Write a program that applies a quick sort method to sort an input sequence in ascending order.

10. Write a program that uses the Shell sort method to sort an input sequence in descending order.

11. Write a program to solve the eight queens puzzle.

12. Write a program to solve the knightâ€™s tour problem.
