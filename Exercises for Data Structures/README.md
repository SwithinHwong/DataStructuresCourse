### Exercises for Data Structures
#### `Chapter 1` Linear List
1. 
Write an algorithm that removes all elements of the linear table A that have a value of b. Assume that there are n (n>0) elements in A, and use a sequential storage structure.

2. 
Write an algorithm that saves all odd-valued elements at the lower-index end in linear table A with the least times of exchanges, and the even-valued element stored at the higher-index end. Assume that there are n (n>0) elements in A, using a sequential storage structure.

3. 
Write an algorithm that deletes all nodes in the linear linked list that have a value of b. The list header is H.

4. 
The linear list A = (a1, a2, ..., am) and B = (b1, b2, ... bn) have m and n elements, respectively, using a linked storage structure. Write an algorithm that combines A and B into:
C=(a1,b1,a2,b2,...,am,bm,bm+1,... bn) 
or
C=(a1,b1,a2,b2,...,an,bn,an+1,... am)

5. 
Write an algorithm that merges the ordered linked lists A and B into a new ordered linked list C. The header pointers of Tables A, B, and C are HA, HB, and HC.

#### `Chapter 2` Array
1. Write an algorithm that converts the sparse matrix A(mXn) into a triple representation.

2. Write an algorithm that computes the sum of the two main diagonal elements of matrix A(nXn).

3. Write an algorithm to find the smallest element in each row of the two-dimensional array A(m, n) and store the value of the element and its position in another two-dimensional array B(m, 3).

4. Write an algorithm to implement the transpose of the matrix A(nXn).


#### `Chapter 3` Stack and Queue

1. Elements a, b, c, d are pushed onto the stack, write an algorithm to judge the validity of popping order in question 1, and check the impossible popping order.

2. Write an algorithm that simulates the operation of a queue (including the enqueue operation and the dequeue operation) with two stacks with the same size.

3. Write a non-recursive algorithm that converts the decimal number to a hexadecimal number and outputs the converted number.

#### `Chapter 4` Tree
1. Write a recursive algorithm to calculate the depth of the binary tree.

2. Write a non-recursive algorithm that swaps the left and right subtrees of the binary tree.

3. Write a non-recursive algorithm to find the node with a value of b in the binary classification tree.

#### `Chapter 5` Graph

1. Write an algorithm to generate a minimum cost spanning tree of weighted undirected connected graphs using the Prim method. The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix.

2. Write an algorithm that traverses an undirected connected graph with a breadth traversal method. The graph is represented by an adjacency matrix.

3. Write an algorithm that counts the in and out degree of each vertex in the directed graph. The directed graph is represented by an adjacency list.
